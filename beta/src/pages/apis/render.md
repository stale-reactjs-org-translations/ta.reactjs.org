## Reference {/*reference*/}

### `render(reactNode, domNode)` {/*render*/}

Call `render` to display a React component inside a browser DOM element.

```js
const domNode = document.getElementById('root');
render(<App />, domNode);
```

React will display `<App />` in the `domNode`, and take over managing the DOM inside it.

An app fully built with React will usually only have one `render` call with its root component.  A page that uses "sprinkles" of React for parts of the page may have as many `render` calls as needed.

[See examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters {/*parameters*/}

* `reactNode`: A *React node* that you want to display. This will usually be a piece of JSX like `<App />`, but you can also pass a React element constructed with [`createElement()`](/TODO), a string, a number, `null`, or `undefined`. 

* `domNode`: A [DOM element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element). React will display the `reactNode` you pass inside this DOM element. From this moment, React will manage the DOM inside the `domNode` and update it when your React tree changes.

#### Returns {/*returns*/}

`render` usually returns `null`. However, if the `reactNode` you pass is a *class component*, then it will return an instance of that component.

#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}

* The first time you call `render`, React will clear all the existing HTML content inside the `domNode` before rendering the React component into it. If your `domNode` contains HTML generated by React on the server or during the build, use [`hydrate()`](/TODO) instead, which attaches the event handlers to the existing HTML.

* If you call `render` on the same `domNode` more than once, React will update the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest JSX you passed. React will decide which parts of the DOM can be reused and which need to be recreated by ["matching it up"](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state) with the previously rendered tree. Calling `render` on the same `domNode` again is similar to calling the [`set` function](/apis/usestate#setstate) on the root component: React avoids unnecessary DOM updates.

* If your app is fully built with React, you'll likely have only one `render` call in your app. (If you use a framework, it might do this call for you.) When you want to render a piece of JSX in a different part of the DOM tree that isn't a child of your component (for example, a modal or a tooltip), use [`createPortal`](TODO) instead of `render`.

### `render(reactNode, domNode, callback)` {/*render-callback*/}

Same as [`render(reactNode, domNode)`](#render), but with a `callback` that notifies you when your component has been placed into the DOM.

#### Parameters {/*render-callback-parameters*/}

* `reactNode`: [Same as above.](#parameters)
* `domNode`: [Same as above.](#parameters)
* `callback`: A function. If passed, React will call it after your component is placed into the DOM.

#### Returns {/*render-callback-returns*/}

[Same as above.](#returns)

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Rendering the root component {/*rendering-the-root-component*/}

To call `render`, you need a piece of JSX and a DOM container:

<APIAnatomy>

<AnatomyStep title="React node">

The UI you want to render.

</AnatomyStep>

<AnatomyStep title="DOM node">

The DOM node you want to render your UI into. The container itself isn’t modified, only its children are.

</AnatomyStep>

```js [[1, 2, "<App />"], [2, 2, "domNode"]]
const domNode = document.getElementById('root');
render(<App />, domNode);
```

</APIAnatomy>

In apps fully built with React, you will do this once at the top level of your app--to render the "root" component.

<Sandpack>

```js index.js active
import './styles.css';
import {render} from 'react-dom';
import App from './App.js';

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

```js App.js
export default function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}
```

</Sandpack>

---

### Rendering multiple roots {/*rendering-multiple-roots*/}

If you use ["sprinkles"](/learn/add-react-to-a-website) of React here and there, call `render` for each top-level piece of UI managed by React.

<Sandpack>

```html public/index.html
<nav id="navigation"></nav>
<main>
  <p>This paragraph is not rendered by React (open index.html to verify).</p>
  <section id="comments"></section>
</main>
```

```js index.js active
import './styles.css';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { Comments, Navigation } from './Components.js';

render(
  <Navigation />,
  document.getElementById('navigation')
);

render(
  <Comments />,
  document.getElementById('comments')
);
```

```js Components.js
export function Navigation() {
  return (
    <ul>
      <NavLink href="/">Home</NavLink>
      <NavLink href="/about">About</NavLink>
    </ul>
  );
}

function NavLink({ href, children }) {
  return (
    <li>
      <a href={href}>{children}</a>
    </li>
  );
}

export function Comments() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <Comment text="Hello!" author="Sophie" />
      <Comment text="How are you?" author="Sunil" />
    </>
  );
}

function Comment({ text, author }) {
  return (
    <p>{text} — <i>{author}</i></p>
  );
}
```

```css
nav ul { padding: 0; margin: 0; }
nav ul li { display: inline-block; margin-right: 20px; }
```

</Sandpack>

### Updating the rendered tree {/*updating-the-rendered-tree*/}

You can call `render` more than once on the same DOM node. As long as the component tree structure matches up with what was previously rendered, React will [preserve the state](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state). Notice how you can type in the input:

<Sandpack>

```js index.js active
import {render} from 'react-dom';
import App from './App.js';

let i = 0;
setInterval(() => {
  render(
    <App counter={i} />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
  i++;
}, 1000);
```

```js App.js
export default function App({counter}) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello, world! {counter}</h1>
      <input placeholder="Type something here" />
    </>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

You can destroy the rendered tree with [`unmountComponentAtNode()`](TODO).
